## 🌸 What This Website Does  

This website is not just a page — it is an **experience**.

When opened, it shows:
- A **pretty red backgroud** with **floating hearts**
- **Photos of me and my dad** floating in an anti-gravity style

### 🖼️ Clickable Photo Magic  
Each photo:
- Floats gently in the air  
- Can be clicked  
- When clicked:
  - The background turns **red with hearts**
  - The photo becomes big
  - A **cute personal message** appears in a popup box
  - If not closed manually, it **closes automatically after a few seconds**

## 💌 Final Surprise Sequence  

After interacting with the photos:

1. The hearts and clouds fade away  
2. A pink **“New Message 💌”** appears  
3. When clicked:
   - A **message box pops up**
4. Clicking that box:
   - A playful **popup-style reveal**
   - Then a new screen appears with:

> **“Happy Birthday Dada, love you ❤️  
> The best dad in the world!”**

This creates a magical, emotional birthday reveal.
